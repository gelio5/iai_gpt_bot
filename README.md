Telegram Chatbot with OpenAI Integration
This is a simple chatbot for Telegram that uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user messages. The bot is implemented in Python using the aiogram library for interacting with the Telegram Bot API.

Setup
To use this chatbot, you'll need to obtain an API key from Telegram and an API key from OpenAI. Here's how:

Create a new bot on Telegram by talking to the BotFather.
Copy the API token for your new bot.
Create an account on the OpenAI website.
Create an API key for your account and copy the key.
Once you have these API keys, you can set them as environment variables in a .env file in the project root directory:

makefile
Copy code
TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=<your Telegram API token>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>
You'll also need to install the Python dependencies using pip:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the chatbot, simply execute the main.py script:

css
Copy code
python main.py
The bot will connect to the Telegram Bot API and start listening for messages. When a user sends a message to the bot, the bot will use the OpenAI API to generate a response and send it back to the user.
